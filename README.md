# WRF-Chem
## A series of R script to post process outputs from the WRFChem (WRF-Chem) air quality model. Maps of regridded data are proposed in an operational way. 

<strong> a)	Run WRF-Chem </strong>
The WRF-Chem model is run following the methodology reported in the script <strong> execute_Model_lsf.sh </strong>. This script reports all the necessary steps to run WRF-Chem in two domain (one main domain (d01) and one nested domain (d02)). However, during the execution, only d01 is processed even if, all the executable files for d02 are also generated. 
N.B. please do not change the methodology to setup WRF-Chem operating with 2 domains. Even if it not currently generating output data for the second domain (4km resolution), it is still the optimal configuration but with long-time run time.
<strong> b)	Post-processing </strong>
WRF-Chem output data are post-processed by the script <strong> POSTPROCESSING.sh </strong>. This script uses .ncl and R codes to generate .tif files to be synchronized into the cesam-web-prod server. 
.tif files are generated by the R script <strong> nc_WRFChem_post_proc_d01.R </strong>. Basically, this script extracts air pollution variables (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3 and CO) from netcdf files and converts them into /tif files (after some cropping and re-gridding).
